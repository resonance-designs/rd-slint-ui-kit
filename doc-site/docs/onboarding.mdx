# Developer Onboarding

Welcome to the `rds-slint-ui-kit` development team! This guide will help you set up your development environment and understand the contribution workflow.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Rust**: [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version).
- **Node.js**: [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for documentation and scripts).
- **wasm-pack**: `cargo install wasm-pack` (for the demo application).
- **IDE Support**: We recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the **Slint** and **rust-analyzer** extensions.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several key areas:

- **`components/`**: Contains the source code for all Slint UI components.
- **`theme/`**: Centralized theme definitions, including color palettes and shared assets.
- **`src/`**: The Rust library that provides the programmatic interface to the components.
- **`wasm-demo/`**: A interactive showcase project used for testing and demonstration.
- **`doc-site/`**: The Docusaurus source for this documentation.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Making Changes to Components

When adding a new component or modifying an existing one:

1.  Place or edit the `.slint` file in the `components/` directory.
2.  If it's a new component, export it in `components/index.slint`.
3.  Verify your changes by running `cargo check` in the project root. This triggers the Slint compiler and ensures there are no syntax or logic errors.

### 2. Testing with the WASM Demo

The `wasm-demo` is the best way to verify component behavior in a real-world scenario:

```bash
cd wasm-demo
wasm-pack build --target web
npx serve .
```

Navigate to the provided local URL to interact with your changes.

### 3. Updating Documentation

If you modify component properties or add new features, please update the documentation:

1.  Edit the corresponding MDX file in `doc-site/docs/components/`.
2.  For new components, create a new MDX file following the existing templates.
3.  Preview your changes:

```bash
cd doc-site
npm install
npm start
```

### 4. Versioning

Before submitting a pull request that includes a version bump, run:

```bash
npm run version
```

This ensures the version number is synchronized across `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, and the documentation site.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Follow existing naming conventions (kebab-case for Slint properties).
- Ensure all public properties and callbacks are documented in the component's doc comments and MDX files.
- Run `cargo check` before committing to catch compilation errors early.
